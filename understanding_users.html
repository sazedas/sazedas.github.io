                <p class="first-letter">Freerice is a non-profit ad-supported system
                    that allows users to play a quiz-like game where correct answers
                    result in the donation of rice through the World Food Programme.
                    The website extols the vocabulary game as a tool to expand their
                    mental lexicon in ways such as being able to better formulate
                    ideas, write more effective papers, speak more precisely, and
                    read faster. Through this website, users can use their knowledge
                    to help end world hunger. Despite this noble cause, the <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">user
                        interface</span> is clunky and unappealing, and the main activity that
                    allows people to donate rice is boring. The web siteâ€™s poor
                    execution prevents it from being a product that most users
                    would want to use.
                </p><br>
                <p class="first-letter">
                    The study objectives include learning <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">how users interact with freerice</span>.
                    It was known which age population(s) most frequently used freerice and
                    whether the purpose of it was for donating or learning.
                    Finding patterns were anticipated regarding the aesthetics
                    of the website. The interviews were guided to focus more
                    on the usability in terms of how long the users spend on
                    the website, how often they visit, and the main purpose
                    as to why they continue or have discontinued their use of the site.

                <p class="first-letter">
                    The <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">target population</span> that the study was interested in was K-12 students,
                    college students, and people who are post studies.
                    For the students who are from kindergarten to high school,
                    assuming they will range from five to eighteen years of age.
                </p>
                <p class="first-letter">
                    Common characteristics among the target population include:
                    <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">motivation to study</span>,
                    <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">interest in donating/helping others</span>,
                    and <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">an interest in learning other subjects like languages</span>
                    or <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">pre-collegiate level topics</span>. In most cases not having
                    a steady form of income or in some cases any income.
                    The target population has a basic understanding of how to
                    navigate a website and how to play a question and answer game.

                <h3 class="text-center text-animation" style="font-size: 28px;">Methods</h3>
                <p class="first-letter">
                    The study methods were <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">interviews</span> and
                    <span style="color:#FFD700;box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px grey">surveys</span>.
                    Interview questions included an ice breaker, an introduction question,
                    key questions, a summary question, and a conclusion question.
                    Some of the key questions were optional depending on the previous answer,
                    this way we could ask specific questions if someone answered a certain way.
                    The total amount of interviews needed done was ten and they would last up to 30 minutes.
                    In addition, the interviews were constructed in an unstructured way so
                    that more questions could be asked and obtain more information about the Freerice website.
                </p><br> 
                <p class="first-letter">
                    The method for the online survey portion was very much up to
                    the people who took the survey. A list of questions were created
                    very similar to the interview questions, but more focused on
                    understanding the users of Freerice. The survey questions were
                    to be taken within 10 minutes, with some questions being optional.
                    The method of directly finding these users of Freerice was through Facebook.
                    Both the methods for this project were done with parental permission
                    if a user was younger than 16 years old.
