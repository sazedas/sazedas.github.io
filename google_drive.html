            <p class="first-letter">Currently, there are over 1 billion users on Google Drive and
                it is one of the most used file sharing and organization services in
                the world. However, because of its massive size and customer reach,
                any single small issue can potentially affect a large amount of
                people. Let’s say for example there is 1 fundamental problem with
                Google Drive, multiply that by 1 billion people and now there is
                effectively 1 billion problems with the system. Any change or
                improvement we can identify can help improve the usability and
                workflow for a large amount of people. Google Drive is straightforward
                to use but that does not mean that it cannot be better. So, we as a team decided
                to look at Google Drive from a CSCW perspective and focused on
                the organization, communication, and the workspace aspects of
                the platform to hopefully find better solutions to these problems.

            <p class="first-letter">
                Google Drive primarily functions as a cloud-based file
                management system used for storing and sharing files.
                In addition to its file management capabilities, Google
                Drive contains integrated CSCW features that enable
                multiple people to work together under a “Shared Drive”
                which was recently renamed from “Team Drive”. Despite
                Google’s efforts to better support computer-supported
                cooperative work, there are still areas that can be improved.
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                Below are some areas of Google Shared Drives that we believe are
                missing in terms of computer-supported cooperative work. The lack
                of these features lead to workflow disruptions and prevent people
                from using the system efficiently:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="first-letter">Google Drive has been playing an increasingly larger role in
                        how people and organizations function and operate, we
                        wanted to know what organizational features on google
                        drive makes users having difficulty using it. For example,
                        it does not have any categorical sorting by file type.
                        Everything is just dumped into a folder making it difficult
                        to stay organized when working with a larger group. Although
                        to look for a specific file we can input a file type query (e.g. pdf)
                        into the search bar and it will display files of that type,
                        it is not perfect - it still shows other file types.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first-letter">We also wanted to know that instead of using another form of
                        communication, if we can have any feature inside google team
                        drive that can allow a team to communicate easily back and forth.

                <li>
                    <p class="first-letter">Another area that we focused on was in Google Drive’s home page where
                        there is a lack of workspace awareness. Currently there is no
                        visual indicator that shows currently who is working on what
                        within the Shared Drive’s home page. There is a way to see
                        if someone is currently working on a file but that requires
                        manually checking each individual file which takes a lot of
                        time and clicks to achieve.</p>

                This study helps us not only understand these problems better
                but can also help us ideate solutions for these problems.
                For now our ideas are just theoretical and based on our
                team’s experience with Google Drive. Further research on
                this topic will give us a larger set of data to analyze from.

            <h3 class="text-center shake-background google-drive-text">Methods</h3>
            <p class="first-letter">
                We started our research off by observing our own group. Throughout
                this quarter we used Google Drive to collaborate on our project
                and through our own experiences, we were able to analyze the
                system and how it worked for us as a CSCW system. Through
                observing each other using Google Drive, we noticed we came
                across a few issues with Google Drive that we believed could
                be improved upon. Evaluating our experience, allowed us to
                question if the issues we faced was common to other users
                utilizing Google Drive as a collaborative system. Therefore,
                for this research, interviews were used as a method for gathering
                information (specifically qualitative data), since the details
                of the frustrations that people had felt with Google Drive would
                be important for our findings. Everyone from the group was required
                to interview at minimum 1 person who uses Google Drive relatively
                often (one member had conducted an extra interview, totaling
                <b>6 interviews</b> conducted).
            </p><br>
            <p class="first-letter">
                For the interview, we had compiled 5 questions about Google
                Drive in regards to cooperation/CSCW, including communication
                and workspace awareness. The questions were presented in a
                way to explicitly detail their gripes with aspects of Google
                Drive. From there, they would also make recommendations as to
                possible resolutions for the problems presented. The analysis
                of these interviews would be finding the major commonality to
                each question and seeing why all of them feel this way and
                drawing conclusions based on their details.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p class="first-letter">As we expected, Google Drive is a popular collaborative tool
                in the world. Most of our interviewees did not feel that
                there was any deficiency in Google Drive until we pointed
                it out. After perceiving each of the interview questions,
                the interviewees realized that they felt like they do not
                know Google Drive the way they used to feel. The findings
                of the research depended on various kinds of factors such
                as interviewees’ age, status, personal experiences, etc.
                Figure 1 below is a graphical report demonstrating the
                interviewees’ personal data.

                Our first two interviewees or user 1 and user 2 both were sixteen
                years old. They are high school students. Both of them found no
                awkwardness on Google Drive and can assuredly rely on Google
                Drive. When asked if they find that Google Drive needs another
                form of communication tool outside of it to help people working
                in different locations, both provided different answers. User 2
                agreed while user 1 did not. User 1 had more experience of using
                Google Drive than user 2. She stated that there is already a
                chat and comment feature in every Google Doc. She found it
                unnecessary to have another form of communication tool. However,
                both user 1 and user 2 agreed on having a better feature to
                categorize documents since this problem can be easily noticed
                by anyone, even for a new user. While asking about the failure
                of workspace awareness in Google’s Team Drive, user 2 did not
                know what Team Drive is, as high school students do not use this
                feature. User 1 did agree on the problem of lack of workspace
                awareness and suggested a notification system to solve this
                collaboration problem.

            <p class="first-letter">
                On the other hand, user 3, 4, 5, 6 ­are all college students.
                They are more experienced users of Google Drive than user 1 and
                user 2. User 3 and 4 found some problems in it, such as a security
                issue, link sharing, downloading Zip files, etc. All the users,
                3, 4, 5, and 6, felt the necessity of having a communication tool
                inside Google Drive. One of the users suggested having a feature
                on updating multiple files individually such as comment, tag, or
                direct line of communication to indicate which files are being
                modified by a user. According to him, this technique would prevent
                two users from editing the same file and uploading their changes,
                which would inevitably overwrite one user's modifications. Google
                Drive most likely has not implemented this feature yet because
                its initial focus was on personal backup and storage, not
                collaboration. Another user suggested adding a form of instant
                messaging such as the one already implemented when you click on
                a file to edit (e.g. Google Docs).
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                However, none of these college students find the lack of
                communication features an issue until we pointed it out.
                Most of the users felt the need for a notification or a
                tagging system on Google Drive. They suggested having some
                features which can design specific files for certain users or
                communicate with enough clarification about which files are
                currently being modified inside Google Drive to prevent any
                overwriting of work. Most of the suggested solutions we
                acquired from users are older and have more experience on
                Google Drive. By following the users’ suggestions, we
                created a user interface mock-up of the future version of
                Google Drive mentioned below in the appendix.
