                This report had been developed with the purpose of identifying
                usability issues of Freerice, an online non-profit food donation
                website, in order to guide the evaluation and redesign of the system.
                The report entailed information regarding methodologies used
                in order to ascertain data and conclusions drawn from this data.

            <p class="first-letter">
                The first step in this process was determining the goals of the system
                as is in order to obtain a better understanding of the purpose of Freerice.
                After determining the goals of the system we were able to develop
                objectives to help guide our study’s tasks. The team determined that the
                research would be guided by the following objectives:
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                    <li>Determine what drives users to use the system</li>
                    <li>Determine why users stop using the system</li>
                    <li>Determine whether the type of food being donated affects users’ interaction with the system</li>
                    <li>Determine whether the knowledge learned from the system is utilized</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3 class="text-center text-animation" style="color:#a9a9a9">Methods</h3>
            <p class="first-letter">
                The study adopted two methods: Usability testing and a cognitive walkthrough.
                The team then developed a series of tasks to drive the usability
                tests, and a separate set of tasks for the cognitive walkthrough.
                The purpose of these tasks was to help the team see how users
                interact with the system when given a task to complete.
                Through this process we were able to gather data on what
                steps users took to achieve this goal and how users interact
                with the system while attempting to complete the given task.
                This aided in determining whether or not system features are
                being used as intended and how the system can be improved.

            <h3 class="text-center text-animation">Findings</h3>
            <p class="first-letter">
                At the time the study was being conducted, Freerice was
                currently undergoing a restructuring, and as such,
                certain functions of the website are hard to use. One
                such example of this is the sign in process.
                In order to sign up for an account on Freerice, a user
                must navigate to the new webpage, create and account there,
                and move back to the original website.
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                This process takes time, not only because both websites are slow and laggy with
                this process, but also because there is not a lot of feedback for the input boxes.
                For example, there is no way of checking if a username is already taken until a user
                has tried to create an account with that username. Furthermore, many text boxes
                that need to be filled out take a lot of time to complete or are redundant. Nearly every participant mentioned or experienced
                lag from the website upon completing this task, which caused further frustration.
                This makes the process of creating an account, one of the most basic features that a
                website would need to create a consistent user base, a huge hassle for any incoming users.
                Furthermore, joining a group is made more difficult by the moving process.
                While some users reported being able to join a group without trouble,
                other users found that they were unable to join existing groups without
                having access codes or creating their own. One user was unable to find
                where to join groups in the first place. This shows two problems.
                First is visibility. The ability to join groups should be placed
                more prominently if the website wants users to interact with that
                feature more. This is important because fostering a community would
                help keep users invested for longer.
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter"><img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" style="float:right" src="usability_image_1.png" alt=""><br><br><br>

                <p class="first-letter">
                    The second problem is that there is not enough feedback in the
                    process for creating groups. Users aren’t told whether they have
                    successfully joined a group in a way that is clear. Other common
                    actions such as changing the levels of questions being answered are
                    also more complicated than they need to be. Freerice has different
                    tiers of questions that are tied to a difficulty level. The ability
                    for users to select a starting difficulty on the web page is at
                    first hidden to users, despite being a key feature.
                </p>
            </p><br>

            <p class="first-letter"><img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail text-center" style="float:left" src="usability_image_2.png" alt=""><br><br><br>
                <p class="first-letter">
                    The only way to change difficulties is to first answer a
                    question on the easiest difficulty. Then, a small text
                    box in an unclear color and font appears.
                </p>
            </p><br><br>

            <p class="first-letter" style="clear:both">
                This made the ability to choose the level of difficulty for questions seems
                like an afterthought and would potentially push away users who are looking
                for more difficult questions to learn from. One of the problems that
                persisted through each question was difficulty finding where to perform
                tasks. Important functions are often found in small fonts, hidden away,
                and in colors that blend into the background.

            <p class="first-letter">
                Some limitations imposed upon our user research were as follows:
            <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                <li>The age group was restricted to primarily students K-12 and
                    collegiate level students and as the site is transitioning some
                    tasks were completed in different ways.
                </li>
                <li>Due to only testing
                    kindergarten through collegiate level students our scope for
                    testing may be limited and skewed towards a younger group of
                    users.
                </li>

                <li>As Freerice is transitioning to an updated website some
                    tasks were not as clear to complete and the testers had to
                    find out ways to complete tasks that the study did not forsee.
