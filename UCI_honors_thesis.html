            <p>
                        Educational technologies can provide an optimum learning
                        experience. Technologies or computers mediate almost every
                        single interaction in these days. If it is possible to get
                        a detailed understanding of how people are using computers
                        day-to-day, it can inform <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">technology design</span> ("Gloria Mark").
                        In the future, we have to design systems for people the way
                        they want, not the way we want them to be ("Design for How
                        People Think (Don Norman)"). This study understood how younger
                        people are using technology today and how they want the design
                        of their technology to be. It obtained an understanding of what,
                        how, and why younger people are using technologies in their daily
                        life. We must support children in ways that are useful, effective,
                        and meaningful for their needs (Druin 2). This research investigated
                        qualities in existing technologies for children that meets their need
                        and motivates them using it. Besides, it probed <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">entertaining</span> and
                        <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">educational technology</span> use patterns in children and scrutinized
                        features in them. Technology design features were analyzed in-depth
                        by applying mix-methods with <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">in-person surveys</span>
                        and <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">observation</span>. A
                        <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">mock-up</span> of the design of future educational technology for children
                        was created with the superior features largely adopting from entertaining
                        technologies that children admired. The mock-up informs design for creating
                        educational technology for children that children can be inspired to use at a higher level.

                        The primary purpose of the research was to analyze

                        implemented in educational technology to help children
                        learn academic content more. It necessitated children
                        to have a practical understanding of what educational
                        technology is and know how to use essential technologies.
                        To be able to use technology and participate in the

                        January 2020 until the end of March 2020. The
                        study was done from 4:30 pm to 5:45 pm from
                        Monday to Thursday and from 2:00 pm to 5:54 pm
                        on Friday. The in-person surveys about technology
                        were conducted for 10 minutes to 30 minutes.
                        The survey questions were read and clarified
                        to children. For each observation session, one
                        hour or more was spent on children's adored
                        technology.  Approximately 20 to 30 minutes
                        was allocated to children's abhorred technology
                        observation. During the observation sessions,
                        notes were taken while children were using
                        technologies.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The thought behind choosing <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">in-person surveys</span> instead of online
                        surveys was, there were possibilities where children might not
                        understand some questions. Thus, there was a likelihood that
                        they could answer something that is not the expected answers
                        to the questions. To avoid this situation, lead researcher
                        sat with them, similar to an in-person interview. Every question
                        was explained and clarified with the participants as many times
                        as it was needed.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The purpose of conducting a <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">field observation study</span> on children
                        was because we know that children are sincere in their
                        feedback and comments concerning technology. Much of what
                        they say may be in their actions and needs to be interpreted
                        within the context of actual experiences (Druin 2). Field
                        research could explore children's real experiences about
                        the technologies they use.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Researchers tried to recognize the influence existing
                        technologies have on child users through the role of users
                        played by children so that future technologies can be changed,
                        or future educational environments can be improved (Druin 3).
                        Understanding which features of technology can inspire children
                        to become a regular user of the technology, exploration through
                        observation of children's <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">technology usage behavior</span> was essential
                        for this research.

                        For the observation session, the technologies were chosen
                        following the survey results. <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">Minecraft</span> was chosen as the
                        entertaining technology to observe as it was rated as
                        the most liked entertaining technology by children in
                        the survey. Children were given an iPad to play with
                        Minecraft since iPad was chosen as the highest-ranked
                        device from where children use entertaining technology.

                        Children were given a computer for observation sessions with

                In Minecraft, children always generated a new world. In survival mode, they bought staffs such as swords,
                construction materials like wood pixels to break stuff, torches to help see dark inside
                the cave.  They kept breaking the things surrounding them to own the item. The rule
                of breaking things is – "whatever you break it, you own it." Children constantly
                broke items and owned them. There was always something in the surrounding where
                they can kill it and own it. Also, participants selected clues such as a map that
                helped them to tell where they currently are and directed them to move in the right direction.
                In the creative mode, they created gardens, crowns, or houses.
                Children were observed to choose survival mode the most, where they had
                a significant amount of helper or clues that helped them continue or win
                the game. Also, in survival mode, children had the privilege to own the stuff they killed.

            <p>
                Children mostly chose poping words, word clouds, holidays, puzzles, and
                number games in ABCya. It was observed that they kept changing games while
                they were using the word or pattern games and were observed having
                difficulty playing them. Whereas when they chose creative games such as
                painting or making pizza, etc. where they created things according to
                their determination, they continued it for a longer time.

    <p>This study investigated what features inspire children to use technology.
        The research showed promising results. Participants pointed out to every
        small component on technologies that they experienced in their life that
        drove them to use or make them disheartened towards them. This study
        recommends the design of educational technology with the features that
        children have declared as motivation promoters for their technology usage.
        Below is a mock-up of the redesigned educational website ABCYa designed
        with the research findings, including all the features that children
        affirmed to be enthusiasm booster. The mock-up was created with the
        wireframing and prototyping tool <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight: bold">Axure</span>.
