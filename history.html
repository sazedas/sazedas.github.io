            <p>
                I was tasked with <b style="color:seagreen;font-size: 18px">application design </b> a new piece of software that captures
                the <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">online history of web sites</b>. The idea was to build an archive
                that allows user to go back to previous versions of any of the
                web sites of which the history is being captured, and to see
                what might be different at different points in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company believed it has a brilliant idea that lots of companies
                will want to use. Universities may want it to understand how the
                catalog has changed; law firms may want to use it to capture what
                laws were application when; businesses may want to capture their
                institutional history and how they portrayed themselves externally;
                and even individuals and families may want to capture their online
                historical presence for future grandkids and more. The company knew
                that creating this software may be very difficult; so it was looking
                at me to figure out what may or may not be possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company has long built a reputation of its existing software,
                thought completely unrelated to this idea, being super usable.
                They would want that to be the case for the new software as well --
                they view it as their key competitive advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company, however, is not versed in software design. It
                hired me to design their new and hopefully revolutionary system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The user will be able to track the history of any website on the internet
                using the Chrome extension History!. The application <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">allows the user to
                view and compare any previously archived websites </b>. The user has full
                control over stopping and starting tracking and also can view a list
                of currently tracked websites.The application has the following features.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Hardware Requirements</h4>
            <p>Since all that’s required for the application is a qualified browser
                and extension, the application will work on any device with a
                browser and internet access. This includes desktops (Mac/Windows),
                mobile devices (iOS/Android) as well as tablets.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Language Support</h4>
            <p>The application will support any language the browser supports.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Accessing archived sites</h4>
            <p>Similar to the UI in Google docs, the user can click to see the
                website history through a Chrome extension at the top of the page.
                The user can interact with the archived version of the webpage as
                if it were the current version.The version history is also available
                for offline viewing.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Tracking Function</h4>
            <p>Once the extension is installed, through a popup on the right side of the
                browser, the user can start or stop tracking on any website. The
                application can track from the present to when a user decides to
                stop tracking a website, or from when any user has started tracking
                the website.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Calculating differences</h4>
            <p>Similar to GitHub, the application saves all incremental versions allowing
                it to compare and highlight differences. The user can view the current
                site and the archived one side by side highlighting what the differences
                are  and two sites can also be viewed between different points in time.
                The comparison of websites is limited to two side by side. In addition
                to highlighting the differences in the two versions, a textual description
                of the images and syntax/sentiment of the language will be provided for
                the two versions.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">Notifications</h4>
            <p>The user will be notified when there is a change in a tracked website
                through a Google Chrome notification. The user can designate the
                frequency and method for notification such as email or SMS.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold">History Range</h4>
            <p>The dates specified for tracking can be a range or specific dates
                Versions are divided by inverse chronological order (newest version comes first)
                By minutes → By hours → By days → By weeks → By months → By years.
            </p>

            <p>
                The conceptual core of this (and any other) software project
                is the architecture design. This project will be implemented
                as a <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">Google Chrome extension</b> because doing so ensures that the
                needs of all audiences and stakeholders are met. In a broad
                view, the architecture of this project involves <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">storing the
                tracked webpage states in a cloud based database</b>. When a user
                decides to start tracking a website that has not yet been
                tracked by any other users, The current state of the web page
                will be stored in the database. Whenever there is a change
                detected in the tracked page, the new page will be stored in
                the database. If there is a change detected, a chrome notification
                will be sent to the user via the chrome.notification API. When
                a user decides to compare previous version of the website they
                are tracking, the current state of the website along with the
                previous states stored in the database will be compared through
                an <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">HTML parsing algorithm</b>, <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">the Cloud Vision API</b>, and <b style="color: seagreen;font-size: 18px">the Cloud
                Natural Language API. The changes detected and described by these
                processes</b> will then be reflected back to the user.
